My Personal Javascript Repo

I plan on housing code snippets for easy access to javascript code when needed

If you happen to come across these pages, and wish to contribute information

Do so, please. 



The structure will be  setup; 

javascript_topic 
-> css, js, index.html
  css 
    -> style.css 
  js 
    -> javascript.js  
  index.html 
    -> will be a way of viewing and testing the material
